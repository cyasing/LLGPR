Lunar Leaper - Preliminary Discussion

1. Detect cavities - caves, tubes - could be dangerous - infrastructure difficult - objective to detect 
2. Simulate GPR measurements for lava tubes
3. Realistic model selection - Discuss with Anna
4. Svein - EM properties of the moon, GPR expertise
5. Svein - Mars Radar
6. gprMax - dipole hertzian use - on the interface
7. Commercial antenna later
8. Ricker - 100 MHz inc. second derivative of Gauss - 100% bW - 50 MHz, 200 MHz.
9. 3D Wave propagation needed - 2D extended 
10. Real Model LIDAR lava tubes -nice if obtainable
11. Example to start
12. Lunar samples properties - use ref. condctivity - iron and Ti components.  - 1/r losss (abs.) , scattering loss also
13. % variation in permittivity with depth - gprmax
14. Fe, statistical properties
15. Large models 
16. gprMax devs can contact
17. Depth of object - 10/20metres to 100 metres, size - 10m to 100s of metres. Some believe it can be horizontal reflector.
18. First Proposal - 15 August deadline
19. Geometrical models of lava tubes on Earth - online - hollow pipe that is extended.
20. Sven - Eric: mid August conferences.

21. Preliminary Model, Quantitative model would be nice.
22. x - drive and y extents - First Fresnel zone lava tubes can constraint - 2x frequency.
