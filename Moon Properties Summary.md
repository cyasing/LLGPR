# Electromagnetic Properties of the Moon's Subsurface

## General

- The depth of investigation would not be limited by material intrinsic loss properties, but by the electromagnetic scattering, which would depend on the scale of heterogeneities in the subsurface.
- Surface materials: silicates characterized by extremely low loss and low electrical conductivity.

## Electrical Permittivity

- $k$ is dominantly controlled by bulk density.
- Largely independent of mineralogy, composition, frequencies above 1 MHz and temperature variations within the range of lunar surface temperatures.

1. Bruggeman-Hanai-Sen (BHS) mixing formula (Sen et al., 1981): Complex Formula
2. Using regression, Olhoeft and Strangway (1975):
    ```math
    k = 1.919^{\rho} \text{, } \rho \text{ is in } g/cm^3
    ```
    Need to compare both results.
3. Permittivity shows no dependence on (TiO2 + Fe) content.
4. Permittivity shows no frequency depenedence below IR.
5. Shows no dependence on frequencies above 1 MHz, ref Figure 9.62.
6. Shows no dependence on temperatures below $200^\circ C$.
7. Permittivity and Loss Tangent Model using Temperature, page 545/71.
8. The temperature dependence of the permittivity (Fig. 9.66) decreases with increasing frequency.
9. Density profiles + formula for permittivity as a function of density to produce a profile of electrical properties with depth in the lunar surface to depths of
100 m.
```math
\rho = 1.91 \dfrac{z+12.2}{z+18} g/cm^3 \text{, } z \text{ in cm.}
```
Should be valid for upto 10s of cm.

## Loss Tangent

1. The loss is strongly dependent upon density and the (TiO2 + FeO) content, and less
dependent on frequency and temperature. Electromagnetic losses in the lunar soils have nearly negligible frequency and temperature dependence in comparison to the behavior of lunar rocks.
2. The extremely low electrical conductivities and low loss tangents indicate that lunar materials are very transparent to electromagnetic energy.
4. Shows strong frequency depenedence below IR, ref Figure 9.63.
5. Shows no dependence on temperatures below $200^\circ C$.

> The apparent minimum seen in the loss tangent for the soil sample near 10 MHz (Fig. 9.60) would suggest that frequency to be the optimum choice for a deep penetrating radar (Olhoeft, 1984) or for long distance subhorizon radio communication through soils.
    > Different for rocks. However, only few rocks exhibit the difference.

6. Temperature dependence of the loss tangent (Fig. 9.67) depends strongly on both temperature and frequency.

## Combined Summary for Permittivty and Loss Tangent

> In summary, the relative dielectric permittivity of lunar rocks and soils is strongly dependent upon density and independent of chemistry; above 1 MHz, it is also independent of frequency and temperature over the lunar surface temperature range. The loss tangent is strongly dependent upon density, chemistry, temperature, and frequency, with a minimum loss near 10 MHz in soils. The best reviews of these properties and the related research are found in Olhoeft and Strangway (1975), trangway and Olhoeft (1977), and Gary and Keihm (1978).

## Electrical Conductivity
- The low conductivity and low loss are also responsible for the fact that lunar materials are readily chargeable and will remain electrically charged for long  periods of time.
- Can be hazardous for equipment during lunar nights. The large photo-induced change in electrical conductivity at lunar sunrise and sunset can charge surface soil particles to the point that they will levitate and move.
    - $1e6$ increase from UV, equivalent to $800^\circ C$ rise in temperature. IR gives $1e1$ rise. This can lead to large movements of electrical charge across solar terminator.
- For lunar soil 
    - ~ 1e-14 mho/m, 300 K, dark
    - ~ Higher than 1e6 increase, light
- For lunar rocks
    - ~ 1e-9 mho/m, 300 K, dark
    - ~ Higher than 1e6 increase, light
- At low frequencies (below 1 Hz), DC conductivity applies, which is extremely low, and dominantly controlled by temperature.
- Because these lunar materials have very low conductivities, dielectric relaxation effects and displacement currents dominate at very low frequencies.
- Usage of electromagnetic induction sounding (electrical conductivity profile) to create a temperature profile (selenotherm).
