2. Add Cylindrical Heterogeneity to a Homogeneous Model - 3D. **
3. (a) Include Permittivity Model to Match Moon's Subsurface - Base **
3. (b) Include Permittivity and Conductivity Model to Match Moon's Subsurface
3. (b) i. Topography - Later
3. (b) ii. Lava Tube
3. (c) Include Permittivity and Conductivity Model to Match Lava Tubes
4. Change Dimensions, etc. to Match More Real Conditions. ** - Interpretation
5. Find and Use Proper Lava Tube Geometrical Models.
6. Parallelize Using OpenMP and/or CUDA. **
7. Use More Complex Antennas.
8. Get Bscans.

### Start with Literature Summary - Each Paper and Book Contribution
+ For proper subsurface model of Marius Hills (as much as possible):
    + Get thickness values of regolith (3.8-5.8 m) and subsequent rock layer (s) (rest - 500 m).
    + Regolith: Find mineral content in percentages - Can make a base layer, with % weight fractal distribution of FeO + TiO2.
    + Rock Layer: Find type(s) of rocks and their percentages (including FeO + TiO2).
    + For all minerals and rocks: Find electric permittivity, electrical conductivity, magnetic permeability, loss tangent/magnetic loss.
    + Exponential rock layering?
